# Project Vision

## Problem
I collect meaningful quotes but they sit forgotten in notes apps. I want these words to actually influence my day, not gather digital dust.

## Target User
Me - someone who saves quotes and wants a simple, passive way to be reminded of them daily through my phone's wallpaper.

## Success Metric
I open my phone and see a quote I saved. It makes me pause for a moment. I don't have to do anything - it just happens automatically, every day.
